# < Project Folder >
<hr/>

* Overview   
  + This folder includes some projects which I did on some lectures and for the graduation. I will be able to fix or add some codes on my repo - especially Graduation/Web Version - as I need to do them for maintaining this system.

* Language   
  + Java (8/11+)
  + C/C++
  + Python 3
<hr/>

### If you want to see codes,   

1. Go to __src__ or __Project__ folder.
2. Select a folder or files in which you are interested.
3. Go inside the folder, and you can __easily__ find my works.
