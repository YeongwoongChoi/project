# < Project Folder >
<hr/>

* Overview   
  + This folder includes some projects which I did on some lectures.

* Language   
  + Java (11+) (almost)
  + C/C++ (just for doing homework)
  + Python (sometimes)   
<hr/>

### If you want to see codes,   

1. Go to __src__ folder.
2. Select the folder in which you are interested.
3. Go inside the folder, and you can __easily__ find the sub-folder which is named as __src__.   
<hr/>

### For Those Who Want to See Another codes,

First of all, they will be codes which accompany with some mini-wise-project ones. They consist of Java and MySQL codes.

Those codes will be in the branch named as "master". - I think that it would be one of my mistakes.
