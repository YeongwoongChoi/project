# < Project Folder >
<hr/>

* Overview   
  + This folder includes some projects which I did on __CS(Computer Science)__ lectures.

* Language   
  + Java (11+) (almost)
  + C/C++ (just for doing homework)
  + Python (sometimes)   
<hr/>

### If you want to see codes,   

1. Go to __src__ folder.
2. Select the folder in which you are interested. - but there is only one project inside xD
3. Go inside the folder, and you can __easily__ find the sub-folder which is named as __src__.
