# < Project Folder >
======================

* Overview
+ This folder includes some projects which I did on __CS(Computer Science)__ lectures.

* Language
+ Java (11+) (almost)
+ C/C++ (just for doing homework)
+ Python (rarely)
=================================

### If you want to see codes,   

1. Select the folder in which you are interested.
2. Go inside the folder, and you can __easily__ find the sub-folder which is named as "src".
